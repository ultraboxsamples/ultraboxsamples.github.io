keep samples for all ages please :D (no weird sounds or filenames)
to add a sample just propose it with a pull request
it will be available as ultraboxsamples.github.io/(filename).mp3 or wav or whatever
i made this because I don't trust making an account on other ultrabox-approved file hosts like filegarden
